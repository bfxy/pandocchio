Pandocchio is my Python practice project that doesn't have any github-stardom ambitions.

If you want a well-made and maintained Python project for similar purposes, please use these tools instead:


* [pypandoc](https://github.com/bebraw/pypandoc), a Python wrapper for Pandoc.
* [python-pdfkit](https://github.com/JazzCore/python-pdfkit), a Python wrapper for [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/).
